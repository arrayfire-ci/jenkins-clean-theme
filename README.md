jenkins-clean-theme - ArrayFire Style
=================

THis is a modified version of the [jenkins-clean-theme](https://github.com/Dakota628/jenkins-clean-theme) tuned for [ArrayFire's CI](http://ci.arrayfire.org).

Installation
=================

This theme depends on the jenkins **simple-theme-plugin**. The jquery for jenkins plugin is also recommended in order to use the sticky footer.

Once the theme is installed, go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure System. Search for "theme".
* For theme CSS use http://ci.arrayfire.org/userContent/jenkins-theme/master.css.

And that's it.
